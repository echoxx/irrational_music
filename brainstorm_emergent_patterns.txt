BRAINSTORMING: Emergent Patterns in Irrational Number Sonification
===================================================================
Date: December 2024

ORIGINAL VISION
---------------
The idea was that playing the digits fast enough might reveal emergent
structure - like:
- Individual movie frames becoming smooth motion at 24fps
- Rapidly alternating notes creating perceived "chords"
- A spinning color wheel blending into a new color

The hope: if pi's digit sequence has some deep mathematical structure,
playing it fast enough might reveal that as an emergent tone, timbre,
or "color."


WHY IT SOUNDS LIKE WHITE NOISE INSTEAD
--------------------------------------
The problem: pi and e's digits are believed to be statistically random
(each digit 0-9 appears roughly equally). So at high speed, you're
essentially playing random frequencies → noise.

It's like spinning a wheel with 10 random colors - you just get gray,
not a meaningful blend.


BRAINSTORMING: WAYS TO REVEAL HIDDEN STRUCTURE
----------------------------------------------

1. POLYPHONIC/ADDITIVE SYNTHESIS
   Instead of playing notes sequentially, stack them:
   - Play digits 1-10 simultaneously as a chord
   - Then digits 2-11, then 3-12...
   - The chord "evolves" through pi's sequence
   - This might reveal harmonic "centers" or textures

2. HARMONIC MAPPING (NOT EQUAL TEMPERAMENT)
   Current: digits map to arbitrary frequency steps
   Alternative: map digits to harmonic series relationships:
   - 0 → fundamental (1:1)
   - 1 → octave (2:1)
   - 2 → fifth (3:2)
   - etc.
   This could make sequences "consonant" vs "dissonant"

3. WINDOWED AVERAGING
   Instead of individual digits, use running averages:
   - Average of digits 1-5 → note 1
   - Average of digits 2-6 → note 2
   - This "smooths" the randomness, revealing slower trends

4. DIGIT GROUPING
   Treat pairs/triples as single numbers:
   - "31" "41" "59" "26" instead of 3,1,4,1,5,9...
   - Creates 100 possible values instead of 10
   - Might reveal patterns at different "scales"

5. FREQUENCY MODULATION
   Use digits to modulate a carrier wave rather than set pitch directly:
   - Base tone at 440Hz
   - Digits control vibrato depth/speed
   - The "color" emerges from modulation patterns

6. SPECTROGRAM ANALYSIS
   Before listening - visualize the frequency content:
   - Generate the audio, render as spectrogram
   - Look for patterns visually that we might not hear


QUESTIONS TO CONSIDER
---------------------
Which approach resonates most with the original intuition?

A) A single emergent tone/pitch emerging from the blur
B) A textural "color" or timbre that's distinct for pi vs e
C) Harmonic patterns or chord progressions revealing themselves
D) Something else entirely?

The answer will determine which experiment to implement first.

DECISION: Expecting A) emergent tone or B) textural color

DETAILED EXPLORATION: HARMONIC MAPPING & DIGIT GROUPING
=====================================================================

HARMONIC MAPPING - FULL OPTIONS
-------------------------------

Option A: NATURAL HARMONIC SERIES (SELECTED)
All tones are overtones of the same fundamental, so they naturally "blend":

Digit → Harmonic → Frequency (if base=220Hz)
0 → 1st harmonic → 220 Hz  (fundamental)
1 → 2nd harmonic → 440 Hz  (octave)
2 → 3rd harmonic → 660 Hz  (octave + fifth)
3 → 4th harmonic → 880 Hz  (2 octaves)
4 → 5th harmonic → 1100 Hz (2 oct + major 3rd)
5 → 6th harmonic → 1320 Hz (2 oct + fifth)
6 → 7th harmonic → 1540 Hz (slightly flat minor 7th)
7 → 8th harmonic → 1760 Hz (3 octaves)
8 → 9th harmonic → 1980 Hz (3 oct + major 2nd)
9 → 10th harmonic → 2200 Hz (3 oct + major 3rd)

Advantage: All frequencies are mathematically related - rapid playback
might create a complex but coherent timbre rather than noise.

Option B: Just Intonation Intervals (within one octave)
Digit → Interval      → Ratio  → Frequency
0     → Unison        → 1/1    → 440 Hz
1     → Minor 2nd     → 16/15  → 469 Hz
2     → Major 2nd     → 9/8    → 495 Hz
3     → Minor 3rd     → 6/5    → 528 Hz
4     → Major 3rd     → 5/4    → 550 Hz
5     → Perfect 4th   → 4/3    → 587 Hz
6     → Tritone       → 7/5    → 616 Hz
7     → Perfect 5th   → 3/2    → 660 Hz
8     → Minor 6th     → 8/5    → 704 Hz
9     → Major 6th     → 5/3    → 733 Hz

Option C: Pentatonic (only 5 consonant notes)
0,1 → C (do)
2,3 → D (re)
4,5 → E (mi)
6,7 → G (sol)
8,9 → A (la)


DIGIT GROUPING - MAPPING 00-99
------------------------------

Option A: Chromatic Across Octaves
00-11 → Octave 1 (C1 to B1)
12-23 → Octave 2 (C2 to B2)
24-35 → Octave 3
...
96-99 → Top of range
Maps to ~8 octaves of piano range.

Option B: Modular (Pitch Class + Octave)
digit_pair % 12 = pitch class (C, C#, D, etc.)
digit_pair // 12 = octave
So: 00=C0, 01=C#0, 12=C1, 25=C#2, 59=B4, etc.

Option C: CONTINUOUS FREQUENCY MAPPING
frequency = min_freq + (digit_pair / 99) * (max_freq - min_freq)
00 → 110 Hz
50 → ~330 Hz
99 → 880 Hz
Smooth gradient across 3 octaves.


USER DECISIONS
--------------
1. Harmonic Mapping: YES to Option A (Natural Harmonic Series)
   - Appeals for the "emergent tone" goal
   - Mathematical relationships might create coherent blending

2. Digit Grouping: Prefers UNIQUE PITCH per number
   - Not discrete chromatic octaves
   - Continuous frequency mapping (Option C) fits this
   - Each of 100 values (00-99) gets its own distinct frequency

3. Irrational Numbers to Explore (in order):
   - √2 (square root of 2) = 1.41421356...
   - 12th root of 2 = 1.05946309... (the semitone ratio!)
   - Then experiment with others:
     * φ (Golden Ratio) = 1.61803398...
     * √3, √5
     * ln(2) = 0.69314718...
     * Euler-Mascheroni constant γ = 0.57721566...

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE - HOW TO RUN EXPERIMENTS
=====================================================================

QUICK START
-----------
Run with: ./run.sh (or /mnt/e/anaconda3/python.exe irrational.py)


CONFIGURATION OPTIONS (lines 364-383 in irrational.py)
-------------------------------------------------------

1. FREQUENCY MAPPING MODE (frequency_mode)

   frequency_mode = 'harmonic_series'   # For emergent tone experiments (RECOMMENDED)
   frequency_mode = 'equal_temperament' # Original 10-step octave
   frequency_mode = 'continuous'        # 100 unique frequencies for digit pairs


2. IRRATIONAL CONSTANTS (constant1, constant2)

   Available options:
   'pi'        # 3.14159...
   'e'         # 2.71828...
   'sqrt2'     # 1.41421... (square root of 2)
   'root12_2'  # 1.05946... (semitone ratio!)
   'phi'       # 1.61803... (golden ratio)
   'sqrt3'     # 1.73205...
   'ln2'       # 0.69314...


3. SPEED SETTINGS FOR EMERGENT TONES

   # Try these for "blending" effect:
   note_duration = 0.02    # Very fast - tones blur together
   note_duration = 0.05    # Fast - beginning to blend
   note_duration = 0.15    # Medium - individual notes still clear

   crossfade_time = 0.01   # Minimal overlap
   crossfade_time = 0.03   # Some blending


RECOMMENDED EXPERIMENTS
-----------------------

Experiment 1: Emergent Tone Test (Harmonic Series)
   frequency_mode = 'harmonic_series'
   constant1 = 'pi'
   constant2 = 'sqrt2'
   num_digits = 100
   note_duration = 0.03    # Very fast
   crossfade_time = 0.02

Experiment 2: Compare Musical Constants
   frequency_mode = 'harmonic_series'
   constant1 = 'root12_2'  # The semitone ratio itself!
   constant2 = 'phi'       # Golden ratio
   num_digits = 50
   note_duration = 0.1

Experiment 3: Fine-Grained (Digit Pairs)
   frequency_mode = 'continuous'  # Uses pairs like "31", "41", "59"...
   constant1 = 'pi'
   constant2 = 'e'
   num_digits = 50            # 50 digit pairs = 100 digits
   note_duration = 0.08


VISUALIZATION
-------------
To enable spectrograms:
   pip install matplotlib scipy

Then set show_spectrograms = True in the config. After playback, you'll
see side-by-side spectrograms comparing the two constants.


WHY HARMONIC SERIES SHOULD HELP
-------------------------------
The harmonic series mode should give a much better chance of hearing
emergent tones since all the frequencies are mathematically related
(integer multiples of 220Hz). When played rapidly, they should blend
into a complex but coherent timbre rather than noise.

Try the very fast settings first!
